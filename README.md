# video-edit

My explorations on video editting and computer vision

### My playing around

- Yolo Model - does object detection but pretty slow
- Hand Rolled Motion Detector via openCV

### Other work

[auto-editor](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor) - Auto trim w/no motion or audio. Except doesn't quite work

     python3 -m auto_editor ~/downloads/delivery.mp4  --ffmpeg_location `which ffmpeg` --edit motion --motion_threshold 0.05
